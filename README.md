# Overview of **R**
## **R** or **Python**
Reference from [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/58602964) and [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/sanqima/article/details/50450189).

1. **R** focuses on better user friendly data analysis, statistics and graphical models, while **Python** emphasizes productivity and code readability.
2. **R** is uncomplicated to apply complex formulas for all kinds of statistical tests and models are readily available and easily used, while **Python** is flexible for doing something novel like building websites.
3. **R** has a steep learning curve at start, you can easily learn advanced stuff once understand the basics. While **Python** pays more attention to readability and simplicity, which makes its learning curve relatively low and gradual.
4. `R` and `Python` are comparable in terms of packages, the former has comprehensive archive network called [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), while the latter has package index called [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/).

The closer you are to statistics, research and data science, the more you might prefer **R**; The closer you are to working in an engineering environment, the more you might prefer **Python**.
Therefore, if you have enough time, you can learn both **R** and **Python**, but for different focuses. That is, use **R** to conduct statistical tests, graph data and inspect large data, use **Python** to write algorithm and deploy services.
Moreover, we can do lots of interesting projects efficiently by integrating **Python** and **R** with [rpython](http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/) and [rpy2](https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/), 

After all, the set of programming languages is [perfect](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectSet.html), which means it has no isolated points.
